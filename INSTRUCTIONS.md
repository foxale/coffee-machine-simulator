# The assignment

Here in Polidea we love coffee and we drink it in gallons. We like it in any form - we drip it, press it… 
Well, ok - not all of us. Some are just lazy and prefer the easy way. :)

The assignment is to design a model of an automatic coffee machine simulator. Exactly the same as you’ve 
probably seen in lots of other offices or maybe even have one at home. 

The idea is dead simple:
1. Choose your favourite drink
1. Press the button
1. Get the coffee
1. Enjoy your beverage!

Simple as that! Make the following assumptions:
* This is just a simulation. You don’t have to model e.g. a _PowerSupply_ class and it’s all parameters (electricity doesn’t matter here). You should focus on the essential components of the machine (eg. WaterTank).
* Machine is fully functional and reliable - it won’t break while used
* Machine doesn’t accept any money (we believe coffee should be free for devs)
* The task shouldn’t take you more than 8 hours.


### What is evaluated?
1. Simplicity of the solution
1. Clean coding
1. Well organized and clear git commit history 
1. Algorithm correctness
1. Well-crafted domain model
1. Automated tests
1. How you justify your decisions (hint: A [INFO.md](INFO.md) file in the repo is a good place to describe your way of thinking).

### What is not evaluated?
1. GUI


### Why should I do it?
This task gives us rough idea about how you code and what is your approach to work you’ve been given.

### OK, how should I proceed?
1. you work on this repo, on your branch
1. once you're done, you submit Merge Request to master branch
1. we will do a code-review and may ask for changes. If you don't know what code-review is, please read [this article](https://blog.philipphauer.de/code-review-guidelines/) so you know what it's all about.
1. you submit changed code
1. we do final review.



## Have fun!
